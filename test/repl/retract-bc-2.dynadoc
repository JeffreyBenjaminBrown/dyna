Changes
=======
a(1) = 0.5.
a(2) = null.
a(3) = null.
a(4) = null.
a(5) = null.

% TODO (bug): `a(X)` did not change even tho it ought to. The `c(X)` values get
% blasted because the don't have an obliviously memoized item inbetween, `h(X)`.

> b(X) = h(X) for X in range(1,6).

% Just to hammer the point home, the rule above shows that `h(X)` values are
% still memoized! It doesn't know that one of it's antecedents has changed.

Changes
=======
b(1) = 0.5.

Solution
========
a/1
===
a(1) = 0.5.
b/1
===
b(1) = 0.5.

% TODO: redefine `g` see if the other rules pick up the new definition.
