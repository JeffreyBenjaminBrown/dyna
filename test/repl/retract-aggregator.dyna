Changes
=======


% try to change to `:=`
> f(X) := 100.

DynaCompilerError:
Encountered error in input program:
 Conflicting aggregators; rule
  f(X) := 100.
 uses ':=' for f/1 but I had been lead to expect '+='.
Everything was syntactically valid, but we could not
see it through.
new rule(s) were not added to program.
