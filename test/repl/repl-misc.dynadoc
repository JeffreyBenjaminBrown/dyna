      Query solution.

        Consider the following example;
          > f(1) := 1.
          > f(2) := 4.

        There a few versions of query:

         - `vquery` shows variable bindings
            > vquery f(X)
            1 where {X=1}
            4 where {X=1}

         - `query` shows variable bindings applied to query
            > query f(X)
            f(1) = 1.
            f(2) = 4.

         - `trace` is an introspection tool for visualizing the derivation of an
           item and its value. Type `help trace` for more information.

> help vquery

See query.
