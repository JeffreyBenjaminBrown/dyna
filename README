An overview of the source tree
------------------------------

external/
  ekmett-trifecta  -- The trifecta parser combinator library, tracked
                   -- as a git submodule.

src/Dyna/

  BackendK3        -- An AST and printer for K3,
                   -- done in finally-tagless style.
                   -- Includes some "Examples", even if not self-tests.

  ParserHS         -- the Haskell front-end parser and selftests

  Term             -- Different representations of terms and
                   --  utilities

  Test             -- code used by self-tests throughout the codebase

  XXX              -- code that should probably go upstream;
                   -- modules here are named by the upstream package.


For those not familar with cabal
--------------------------------

First, ensure that you have GHC 7.6 or later.

Then, sadly, I have to ask you to build some upstream packages out of their
repositories.  I thought they were going to be released "soon" when I
switched to these later versions, but it hasn't happened yet:

git submodule init
git submodule update
(cd external/ekmett-trifecta; cabal install --user)

Then fetch, build, and install any dependencies

(cabal install --enable-tests --only-dependencies)

Build Dyna:

cabal configure --user --enable-tests
cabal build
cabal haddock
cabal test

And then run the REPL:

./dist/build/drepl/drepl

OK, that last bit is probably not quite true.  At this point, the code is
still rather "in the works" so you probably want to load some module in
GHCi; for example:

ghci -isrc Dyna.ParserHS.Parser
