.. Dyna2 documentation master file

Welcome to Dyna2's documentation!
=================================

Dyna2 is an experimental new logic programming language developed at
`Johns Hopkins University <http://www.jhu.edu>`_

.. warning:: Please be advised that this documentation, the implementation,
   and indeed the language itself are rapidly changing.

.. warning:: Attempting to run Dyna programs may often crash our interpreter
   or yield programs which run forever.  (In the latter case, Control-C will
   stop the program's execution.)  If either of these things happen
   unexpectedly, please contact a TA.
